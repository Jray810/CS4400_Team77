Using python version >= 3.4, create and start a python virtual environment (this prevents conflicts with system wide python packages):
On MacOS and Linux:
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
$ env\Scripts\activate.bat

Install dependencies:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running instructions

If you have everything installed properly, you should be able to run it just by doing:
$ python3 travelReservationService.py

And then go to a browser and type in http://localhost:5000/ and it should take you to the website
